- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sasquatech. I'm a non-IT guy certified in turning it off and on again with some training in networks and security.
- Iâ€™m currently in a non-technical role where I write long helpdesk tickets and make printers work by threatening them.
- Currently self-learning HTML, CSS, & JS. Hoping to build tools to automate as much of my job as possible.
